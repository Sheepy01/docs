## üíä Capsule Details

A further look into what's in your Capsule and how you can use it:

* **0.2 ETH (Sepolia Ether):**
  * Sepolia ether acquired from your Capsule can be tunneled (bridged) and used to interact with and build dApps on Hemi by paying transaction fees.
* **0.2 ETH (Tunneled Sepolia Ether):**
  * Hemi Sepolia ether comes ready to use when you claim your package, allowing you to immediately interact with and build dApps on Hemi by paying transaction fees.
* **0.1 tBTC (Testnet Bitcoin):**
  * tBTC is **essential** to run a PoP miner.
  * In the future, you will be able to tunnel your tBTC (and other Bitcoin assets) to Hemi for use in Bitcoin DeFi deployed on Hemi.
* **1 tHEMI (Testnet Hemi):**
  * tHEMI is the governance token for the Hemi Network's testnet phase.
  * tHEMI tokens are used for payouts to PoP miners as a means of acknowledging their contribution to the network's security and functionality. In the future, these incentives will expand to individuals running Sequencers, Publishers, and Challengers.
