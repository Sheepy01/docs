## üíä Onboarding Capsule

To streamline the process of obtaining required assets to jumpstart exploration in the Hemi ecosystem, the Hemi team has created a unique **onboarding Capsule.**

**Why claim an onboarding Capsule?**

* **Comprehensive Toolkit:** Receive all the essential assets needed to begin building on the Hemi testnet in a single, easy-to-access package.
* **Ready-to-Use Resources:** Each Capsule includes ETH (Sepolia), ETH (Hemi Sepolia), tBTC, and tHEMI, enabling you to seamlessly onboard to testnet in one click.
* **Gasless Transaction:** Capsule is delivered through a gasless transaction, meaning you can explore and build without incurring transaction fees.

üéÅ Your onboarding Capsule contains:

* **0.2 ETH (Sepolia Ether):**
  * Sepolia ether acquired from your Capsule can be tunneled (bridged) and used to interact with and build dApps on Hemi by paying transaction fees.
* **0.2 ETH (Tunneled Sepolia Ether):**
  * Hemi Sepolia ether comes ready to use when you claim your package, allowing you to immediately interact with and build dApps on Hemi by paying transaction fees.
* **0.1 tBTC (Testnet Bitcoin):**
  * tBTC is **essential** to run a PoP miner.
  * In the future, you will be able to tunnel your tBTC (and other Bitcoin assets) to Hemi for use in Bitcoin DeFi deployed on Hemi.
* **1 tHEMI (Testnet Hemi):**
  * tHEMI is the governance token for the Hemi Network's testnet phase.
  * tHEMI tokens are used for payouts to PoP miners as a means of acknowledging their contribution to the network's security and functionality. In the future, these incentives will expand to individuals running Sequencers, Publishers, and Challengers.

**ü•ö Easter Egg**

If you happened to join Hemi testnet in the first month of participation and claimed your onboarding Capsule, you might have discovered an easter egg -- a limited "Air" Hemi Hatchling NFT!&#x20;

* These limited NFTs were only available through the onboarding Capsule. As of August 20, 2024, we have suspended the minting of these limited NFTs to provide the community with a special NFT honoring their initial participation in Hemi. Will there be more/different NFTs? Stay tuned.
* **Collect Other Hatchlings:** Although we are no longer minting the limited Air Hemi Hatchling NFT, you can[ collect other elemental hatchlings](../tutorials/mint-a-hemi-hatchling-nft.md) and learn more about how it works.
