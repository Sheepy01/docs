### 4. Connect to Claim

* Enter the receiving Hemi Sepolia address or connect your preferred EVM wallet.
* **Network Warning:** Make sure to switch to the Hemi Sepolia Network. (A warning will pop up if you haven't switched.)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Note: You will receive an error when trying to claim your Capsule if you have not switched to the Hemi Sepolia Network.
{% endhint %}

### 5. Redeem

* Once you are properly connected, you can click `Redeem`.





**🥚 Easter Egg**

* If you happened to join Hemi testnet in the first month of participation and claimed your onboarding Capsule, you might have discovered an easter egg -- a limited "Air" Hemi Hatchling NFT!&#x20;
* These limited NFTs were only available through Capsule. As of August 20, 2024, we have suspended the minting of these limited NFTs to provide the community with a special NFT honoring their initial participation in Hemi. Will there be more/different NFTs? Stay tuned.
*   When you click **`View the onboarding transaction here`** (from the previous step) you will see the different Tokens transferred.

* **PoP Protocol:** Hemi Hatchlings use the PoP protocol to achieve Superfinality. Read more about that at [pop-consensus-and-bitcoin-finality.md](../../foundational-topics/proof-of-proof/pop-consensus-and-bitcoin-finality.md "mention").
* **Collect Other Hatchlings:** Although we are no longer minting the limited Air Hemi Hatchling NFT, you can collect other elemental hatchlings by visiting [Hemi Hatchlings](https://hemihatchlings-test.hemi.xyz/) and learning more about how it works.

**How to View Your Hemi Hatchling**

1. In your MetaMask wallet, under NFTs, you should see your Hemi Hatchling. If you don't, you may need to add your Hatchling manually.&#x20;

  * Enter the [Air Hemi Hatchling Address](https://testnet.explorer.hemi.xyz/token/0x3F5c3083EC12bd7301371655714A0896e8d56f22) and **your Token ID**

* **Success! Your NFT was added!**
  * **Pixelated Hatchlings:** All Hemi Hatchlings during the testnet will be pixelated. This is intentional.
  * **Air Hemi Hatchling Airdrop:** If you claim an Air Hemi Hatchling, you will receive an airdrop of that Hemi Hatchling during the Hemi mainnet. We will airdrop the real NFT to everyone during that period if you collected one in your Capsule during testnet.
  * **Temporary Elements:** All other elemental Hemi Hatchlings are temporary and just for the testnet. You will be able to collect those same elements during the mainnet (only the Air Hatchling is one of a kind for users who came here early).
