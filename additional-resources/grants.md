## Getting Started

We are always open to new ideas, but here are some specific areas we believe will have the most impact and can help get you started

***

## Bitcoin "Intelligent" dApps

Any dApp you are passionate about building that would benefit from Bitcoin awareness.

* Non-Custodial BTC / BTC Asset DEXes
  * A decentralized exchange to trade Bitcoin or Bitcoin-based assets without requiring users to give up custody of their funds.&#x20;
* Non-Custodial Bitcoin Lending
  * A dApp to enable Bitcoin-based lending (either borrowing Bitcoin itself or using Bitcoin as collateral for other loans) without users giving up custody of their funds.&#x20;
* Bitcoin "smart wallets" with custom key manager sets
  * Users/smart contracts create Bitcoin wallets controlled by configurable validator sets and managed on Hemi; smart wallet owners can specify transactions that should be performed on Bitcoin from their wallet, and validators work together to sign and propagate on Bitcoin
* Bitcoin "transaction forwarding"
  * A dApp where users/smart contracts can send tunneled BTC on Hemi to a liquidity provider, who then sends tunneled BTC to the senderâ€™s specified destination.
* Bitcoin MEV Marketplace / Tx Accelerator
  * A dApp where users can submit raw Bitcoin transactions or their hashes along with an attached reward (in $HEMI, $ETH, etc.), which will be paid out to the Bitcoin miner that includes their specified Bitcoin transaction in a block
* Ordinals/Inscriptions "minting-as-a-service"
  * A service that facilitates the creation of Ordinals.&#x20;
* Any other novel Bitcoin dApp that benefits from introspection into Bitcoin data

_**Have fun with it! We want to hear your ideas!**_&#x20;
