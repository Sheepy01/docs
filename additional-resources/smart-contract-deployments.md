## Smart Contract Deployments

<details>

<summary><strong>Why is my smart contract deployment failing on the testnet even though the contract seems to be created?</strong></summary>

**üåê Overview**

* &#x20;Deployment issues on testnet can stem from using features or opcodes not yet supported by the testnet's version of the EVM.

*   Check the `Raw trace` tab

**üëÄ Common Culprits**

* <mark style="color:blue;">One frequent cause is the use of the</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">`PUSH0`</mark><mark style="color:blue;">opcode, which was introduced in</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**EIP-3855**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">with the</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">**Shanghai upgrade**</mark>_<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>

**‚úÖ Solutions**

* To avoid such issues, it's best to wait until testnet officially supports these new features before attempting to deploy contracts that rely on them.&#x20;
* üìú We will make an announcement when we update this soon!

<summary>Gas Usage (e.g. are you at 100%?)</summary>

**üåê Overview**

* Deployment failures can often be traced back to insufficient gas allocation.
* When a transaction consumes all allocated gas without completing, the network rejects it to avoid executing transactions that could run indefinitely.

**üëÄ Common Culprits**

* **100% Gas Consumption:** If a transaction fails and the gas usage is 100%, it suggests the gas limit set for the contract's deployment was too low to cover the computation required.
  * Check `Gas usage & limit by txn`



**‚úÖ Solutions**

* **Increase Gas Limit:** Adjust the gas limit upwards based on the complexity of your contract and the estimations provided by gas estimation tools.
* **Optimize Contract Code:** Review and optimize your smart contract code to reduce gas consumption. This can involve simplifying functions, removing unnecessary operations, or leveraging patterns that consume less gas.
* **Test Thoroughly**

<summary>Did you verify your Smart Contract?</summary>

**üåê Overview**

Preparing your smart contract for deployment involves a critical step: <mark style="background-color:green;">verification</mark>. This process not only helps in catching potential issues early but also enhances the contract's integrity before it goes live.&#x20;

**üîç Verification is Key**

Verifying your smart contract is paramount to ensure its readiness for deployment. This crucial step provides valuable insights into any potential errors or vulnerabilities that could compromise its performance or security.

**üõ† Steps to Verify:**

* **Navigate to Contract Details:** Access your contract's details within your development environment or via a testnet blockchain explorer where your contract will be deployed.
* Look for the `Verify and Publish` option. **Selecting this begins the verification process, which is essential for assessing whether your contract operates as intended and is ready for interaction with users.**

## Navigating the Hemi Portal

<details>

<summary>What tokens are currently supported?</summary>

You can use our platform to access a variety of tokens, including ETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where is the faucet?</summary>

The faucet can be found in the [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/1202677849887080508/1230886659222929418). You can get more testnet tokens from there.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is tunneling? What is a tunnel?</summary>

The Hemi Tunnel is designed for seamless cross-chain transactions.

Hemi‚Äôs Bitcoin and Ethereum Tunnels improve security while decentralizing asset portability. They do this by leveraging the Hemi Virtual Machine, which gives the network direct awareness of Bitcoin‚Äôs and Ethereum‚Äôs states.

</details>

## Capsules

<details>

<summary>What is Capsule?</summary>

Capsule is an asset transfer protocol that allows anyone to batch and transfer multiple assets in a single package on Hemi. Additionally, it provides users and developers with advanced functionality like gasless transactions, re-routing/recalling, and configurable security.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are Capsules used for Hemi onboarding?</summary>

The Hemi Onboarding Capsule contains all the testnet tokens (tBTC, ETH, and tHEMI) you need to start building / interacting on Hemi in one gasless transaction! Once you claim your onboarding capsule, you‚Äôll have everything you need to try out PoP mining, pay transaction fees, and use Hemi‚Äôs tunnels.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many onboarding Capsules can be claimed?</summary>

Only one onboarding Capsule may be claimed per user.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is included in my Capsule?</summary>

tBTC (testnet Bitcoin), ETH (Sepolia ether), tHEMI (testnet HEMI) and a special testnet NFT.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I use the assets I redeem?</summary>

* **ETH**: Ether acquired from your Capsule can be tunneled (bridged) and used to interact with and build dapps on Hemi by paying transaction fees.
* **tBTC**: tBTC is essential to run a PoP miner. In the future, you will be able to tunnel your tBTC (and other Bitcoin assets) to Hemi for use in Bitcoin DeFi deployed on Hemi.

<!---->

* **tHemi:** tHEMI is the governance token for the Hemi Network's testnet phase. **tHEMI tokens are used for payouts** to PoP miners as a means of acknowledging their contribution to the network's security and functionality. In the future, these incentives will expand to individuals running Sequencers, Publishers, and Challengers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What‚Äôs the benefit of claiming a Capsule on Hemi testnet?</summary>

* **Comprehensive Toolkit**: Receive all the essential assets needed to begin building on the Hemi testnet in a single, easy-to-access package.
* **Ready-to-Use Resources**: Each Capsule includes ETH (Sepolia), tBTC, tHEMI, and a special testnet NFT, enabling you to seamlessly onboard for Testnet in one 1-click.
* **Gasless**: A Capsule is delivered through a gasless transaction, meaning you can explore and build without incurring transaction fees.
