## üí° Technologies Behind Hemi's Advantages

{% hint style="success" %}
*   #### Ease of Development

    The Hemi Virtual Machine (hVM) integrates a full Bitcoin node within an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), providing developers with a familiar programming interface while harnessing the power of both Bitcoin and Ethereum.
*   **Bitcoin Superfinality**&#x20;

    Hemi's **Proof-of-Proof (PoP)** consensus mechanism ensures transactions surpass Bitcoin's level of security in just a few hours.
*   **Trustless Cross-chain Portability**

    The hVM's unique awareness of Bitcoin's and Ethereum's states enables secure, seamless asset transfers between Hemi and other chains through its "Tunnels" feature.
*   **Bitcoin-first DeFi**

    The Hemi Bitcoin Kit provides detailed access to Bitcoin state, enabling smart contracts to support sophisticated DeFi applications previously not feasible.
*   **Extensibility**

    Hemi allows external projects to create their own chains secured by Hemi's technology, facilitating Bitcoin-Security-as-a-Service and enhancing dual-chain interoperability.
*   **Superior Asset Handling**

    Advanced on-chain functionalities, including routing, time-lock, and password protection, are made possible through Hemi, elevating asset management and security.
