To-date, scaling Web3 has focused on building layers on top of the two biggest networks â€” Bitcoin and Ethereum.&#x20;

We addressed the compromises those projects had to make.&#x20;

Then we focused our energy where few dared â€” the underexplored areas in between.

`Introducing Hemi: A modular network built to support and scale the next great applications on Bitcoin and  Ethereum.`
