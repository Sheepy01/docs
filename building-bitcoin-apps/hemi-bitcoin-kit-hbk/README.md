# Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK)

{% hint style="info" %}
## üìú **TL;DR:**

* The Hemi Bitcoin Kit is a library of smart contracts for developers to use.
* The Kit provides rich data, reliability, and security so that developers can cheaply and easily make dApps ‚Äî and build on other applications.
* This level of programmability will enable Bitcoin apps that previously would have been impossible or impractical to build.

## üåê Overview

* The Hemi Bitcoin Kit (hBK) is a set of smart contracts designed to bridge the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains, enabling easy interaction between the two.&#x20;
* The hBK builds upon the hVM foundation to offer developers an accessible and user-friendly interface for interacting with the Bitcoin blockchain.

***

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

* At the core of the Kit's functionality is the hVM (hemi Virtual Machine), a novel technology that embeds a fully indexed Bitcoin node within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
*   The hVM facilitates direct communication between Ethereum smart contracts and the Bitcoin blockchain via precompiled calls. These calls allow smart contracts to query Bitcoin indexers and return the results back to the EVM.&#x20;

    _This process ensures efficient and reliable access to Bitcoin blockchain data from within Hemi smart contracts._
* The hBK abstracts technical details such as data serialization and assembly language to provide developers with simple, straightforward methods to perform basic data queries and asset transfers.
* Functions within the hBK can be categorized into two types:&#x20;
  * **Direct passthroughs to precompiles:** Passthrough functions serve as simple gateways to precompiled calls, handling all necessary serialization and deserialization behind the scenes.
  * **Enhanced functions:** Enhanced functions, on the other hand, may combine multiple precompile calls or incorporate additional processing steps to facilitate more advanced queries or operations.&#x20;
* This dual approach ensures that developers can effectively leverage the Bitcoin blockchain's capabilities within their Hemi applications, without needing to navigate the intricacies of direct precompile interaction.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How is hBK Unique?

* The hVM is based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and comes stocked with built-in shortcuts precompiled to abstract away complex transactions. These make it easier for developers to create their own smart contracts and, by extension, build decentralized applications. Just as important, it makes the development of such applications relatively cheap‚Äîthe infrastructure is there for anyone to tap into.
* Because the hVM is an EVM wrapped around a Bitcoin node, it automatically extends that easy DeFi programmability to Bitcoin-based assets.&#x20;
* The Hemi Bitcoin Kit makes dApp development even easier. The Hemi Bitcoin Kit is a library of smart contracts that abstract away the precompile process. They seamlessly translate smart contract queries so that data is easier to deal with.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Hemi Bitcoin Kit brings five benefits to developers:

* **Easier development:** Any Bitcoin data you want is one smart contract call away.
* **Rich data:** You get access to data that is impractical or outright impossible to get with other solutions.
* **Security and reliability:** dApps get immediate information about any relevant events on the Bitcoin blockchain without having to rely on third-party relayers or trusted oracles.
* **Composability:** Anyone can design new layers of Bitcoin DeFi infrastructure for others on which to build.
* **Cost-effectiveness:** The hVM uses far less gas than other approaches and there's no need to incentivize third-party bots to watch for and relay events.

## üèóÔ∏è Use Cases

Some examples of unique applications that the Hemi Bitcoin Kit enables:

* **Custom Bitcoin tunnels:** Connect chains to the Bitcoin network using customized security, cost, and speed settings.
* **Trustless BTC staking and re-staking protocols:** 99% of BTC is unbridged and/or unproductive. With Hemi, BTC can be used to secure networks and earn yield.&#x20;
* **Bitcoin-authenticated AI-model marketplaces:** AI model owners can publish Bitcoin-secure hashes of their model weights, timestamping to Bitcoin.
* **Multichain DAOs:** Hemi DAOs operate across both Bitcoin and Ethereum, making decisions based on the collective input of stakeholders from both communities.
