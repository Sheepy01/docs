# The Architecture

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* **The Hemi Network operates four** kinds of specialized nodes: Bitcoin finality governors, Bitcoin-secure sequencers, Proof-of-Proof miners, and a modified Geth node.
* The network’s nodes maintain its EVM and ensure decentralized operability across **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and other EVM-compatible chains.
{% endhint %}

***

## 🌐 Overview

* The Hemi Network connects to both the **Bitcoin and Ethereum networks**, allowing asset portability across both, enabling a third-party cross-chain ecosystem. To create this highly secure multichain ecosystem, the Hemi Network operates several kinds of decentralized nodes: **Bitcoin finality governors, Bitcoin-secure sequencers, Proof-of-Proof miners, and a modified Geth node.**

***

## 🛡️ **Bitcoin Finality Governors (BFGs)**

* Regulate the network's security status by analyzing Bitcoin blocks for Hemi Network state proofs.
* Determine the network's finality status, ensuring security.
* Coordinate with Bitcoin-secure sequencers and proof-of-proof miners.

***

## ⚙️ **Bitcoin-Secure Sequencers (BSS Nodes)**

* Integrate Hemi Network transactions with Ethereum mainnet transactions.
* Maintain the network's consensus layer and manage staking, unstaking, and slashing operations.
* Ensure a seamless connection between the Hemi Network and Ethereum for asset transfers.

***

## 🛠️Modified Geth Node

* Operates as a customized Ethereum node, providing compatibility and connectivity between the Hemi Network and Ethereum.
* Ensures data synchronization and transaction processing within the Hemi Network ecosystem.

***

## 🔗 **Proof-of-Proof Miners (PoP Miners)**

* Secure the network by embedding state proofs into the Bitcoin blockchain.
* Hash network headers to create cryptographic proofs and publish these to Bitcoin.
* Receive tokens as rewards for their contributions.
