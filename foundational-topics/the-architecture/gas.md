# Gas

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 TL;DR:

* **Gas fees in the Hemi Network** are paid using ETH, the network's native token.
* This approach is similar to Ethereum Layer 2 rollups like Optimism, where gas fees are in their native bridged tokens.
* To interact with the Hemi Network, users can obtain ETH (or claim through the faucet in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2DnVTugBf2)) and [tunnel](https://docs.hemi.xyz/tunnel-sepeth-to-hemi) to Hemi.

## 🔧 **Fee Mechanisms: Other Networks**

* For example, in the **Bitcoin network**, transaction fees are paid in BTC. **Ethereum**, on the other hand, uses ETH as gas. These fees serve the same fundamental purpose across different blockchains but are paid in the respective network's native tokens.
