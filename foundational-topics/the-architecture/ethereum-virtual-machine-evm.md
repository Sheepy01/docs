# Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) serves as a global, decentralized computer designed to execute smart contracts.
* The Hemi Network offers seamless compatibility with the EVM, allowing it to not only execute Ethereum-based smart contracts directly but also facilitate interactions among various smart contracts across networks.
* **The Hemi Network also extends this compatibility to Bitcoin** through a protocol-level awareness of the state of the Bitcoin network.

## 🌐 **Overview**

* **The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** represents a cornerstone of blockchain technology, functioning as a distributed computational engine that executes smart contracts. These contracts are _self-executing agreements_ with the terms directly written into code, enabling a wide array of decentralized applications (DApps). The Ethereum network's primary role is to maintain the operational integrity and accessibility of the EVM, ensuring a trustless environment for executing these contracts.

## 💡 **An EVM-Compatible L2**

* On the innovative front, the Hemi Network emerges as an EVM-compatible Layer 2 (L2) solution, architecturally designed atop Ethereum's foundation.
* This compatibility empowers the Hemi Network to directly execute smart contracts developed for the Ethereum ecosystem and establish communicative bridges with other EVM-compatible smart contracts, fostering an interconnected blockchain environment.

## 🔗 **Integration with Bitcoin**

* Through a deep, protocol-level insight into Bitcoin's state, the **Hemi Network** facilitates the creation and execution of EVM-compatible smart contracts that can interact with Bitcoin. This expands the utility and applications of smart contracts and tunnels the capabilities of Ethereum with the robust security and widespread adoption of Bitcoin, marking a significant advancement in blockchain interoperability and functionality. 🤝
