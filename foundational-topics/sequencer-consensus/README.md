# Sequencer Consensus

{% hint style="info" %}
## 📜 **TL;DR:**

* This approach addresses key PoS vulnerabilities: weak subjectivity and censorship attacks.
* Forged chains would be invalidated by the state proofs on the Bitcoin network.
* Integration with the Bitcoin network validates the blockchain and helps maintain integrity even under attack.

## 🌐 **Overview**

The Hemi Network utilizes the Bitcoin-Secure Sequencer (BSS), a type of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) node, to achieve consensus, or agreement, on the network’s status. By leveraging the Bitcoin blockchain, the Hemi Network decentralizes its security measures, reducing reliance on internal network validators.

_**Enhanced Consensus Mechanism**_

_The network combines traditional PoS with Proof-of-Proof (PoP), creating a more secure and robust consensus mechanism than standard PoS systems._

## 🛠️ **How?**

⛓️ It incorporates state proofs from the Bitcoin network to validate the Hemi blockchain, ensuring the network's history cannot be easily altered or falsified.

🛡️ The hybrid model provides a unique defense against majority stake attacks, a common vulnerability in pure PoS networks.

🔐 In the event of an overwhelming attack, the network can offload transactions to the Bitcoin network, ensuring continuous operation and security.
