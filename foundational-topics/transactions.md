# Transactions

{% hint style="info" %}
## üìú TL;DR:

* **A cryptocurrency transaction updates a network's decentralized ledger.**
* _It requires the sender's cryptographic signature to ensure the transaction is authorized._
* **To increase the speed and number of transactions, transactions can be offloaded to an L2 network**, which bundles transactions before settling them on the main chain.
* **Transactions on the Hemi Network inherit the programming abilities of Ethereum and the robust security of Bitcoin** while still encouraging decentralization and resistance to censorship.&#x20;

## üåê **Overview**

* **A cryptocurrency transaction fundamentally represents an update to the network's decentralized ledger.**
* Such a transaction mandates a cryptographic signature from the sender's wallet, serving as a verification mechanism to authorize the transaction. Within the Bitcoin ecosystem, scripting capabilities enable the execution of more complex transaction types.
* Conversely, **Ethereum operates as a distributed virtual machine,** allowing for the execution of sophisticated programs known as smart contracts. These contracts, embedded directly on the blockchain, can operate autonomously based on their programming.

## ‚öñÔ∏è **The Blockchain Trilemma and L1 Challenges**

* L1 chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum typically have relatively slow transaction times‚Äîa problem commonly known as the blockchain trilemma.&#x20;
* The process of improving transaction throughput on a blockchain necessitates an expansion of data storage capacity, as each transaction must be individually recorded on the ledger. This requirement potentially centralizes the operation of full nodes to entities possessing considerable computational and financial resources.
* In response, Layer 2 (L2) networks present a strategic solution by aggregating multiple transactions off-chain prior to their collective finalization on the primary Layer 1 (L1) blockchain. This methodology not only preserves the foundational security principles of the L1 blockchain but also contributes to a reduction in transaction fees and an acceleration of transaction processing times, thereby enhancing the efficiency and accessibility of blockchain technology. ‚è©

## üåâ **Tunneling Ethereum & Bitcoin with Hemi**

* The Hemi Network, as an EVM-compatible Layer 2 network built to bridge Ethereum and Bitcoin, enables rapid transaction settlement and finality.  Transactions inherit the complex programming abilities of Ethereum and the robust security of Bitcoin.  The Hemi Network‚Äôs design also encourages greater decentralization than typical L2 networks, preventing censorship and ensuring open access.
